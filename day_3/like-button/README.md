# 🎯 Task 2: Like Button

## Task: Create a like button that toggles between liked and unliked

**Requirements:**
1. Create `LikeButton.jsx`
2. Use useState to manage liked state (boolean)
3. Show different text/color when liked vs unliked
4. Display like count (starts at 0, increases/decreases on toggle)
5. Use emoji: ❤️ when liked, 🤍 when unliked

**Sample Output:**
```
[❤️ Liked] 1 like
(Click to toggle)
[🤍 Like] 0 likes
```

## Challenge: Disable button for 1 second after clicking (prevent spam)
